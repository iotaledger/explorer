## About

This repository is where the IOTA Foundation hosts the open-source code for the [Tangle Explorer website](https://explorer.iota.org/).

![Tangle Explorer](images/tangle-explorer.png)

The code is composed of the following packages:

- [**`api`:**](api/README.md) Handles functionality such as lookups for the client
- [**`client`:**](client/README.md) Provides a user interface for the explorer, using React.

A demonstration of the API is available [here](https://explorer-api.iota.org).

This is beta software, so there may be performance and stability issues.
Please report any issues in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/iotaledger/explorer/issues/new).

```bash
node -v
```

If Node.js is installed, you should see the version that's installed.
