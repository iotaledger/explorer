    "description": "<p>In IOTA 2.0, a block is a fundamental unit within the Tangle, which is the underlying data structure of the network, organized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each block in IOTA 2.0 carries a payload and is linked to previous blocks through references, embodying the network's transactions and data processing mechanisms.</p>",
